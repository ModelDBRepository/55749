Breakdown of accommodation in nerve: a possible role for persistent sodium
current.

are available in this directory.

To demonstrate Figure 1D from the paper start matlab and cd to this directory.
Cut and past the following three lines into the matlab command line:

[TS] = [10 20 30 40 50 100 150 200];
[X]  = [2.5 -20 0.5];
[T] = test_ac(X,TS);

In about six minutes on a 800 MhZ Pentium PC two graphs, an action potential
and also Figure 1D, appear.

These files were supplied by Dr Hennings.
